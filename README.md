# 👋 Hi, I'm Emiliano

I'm a Computer Engineering student from Argentina, passionate about building low-level software that interacts closely with hardware. I enjoy coding in general, but I feel especially drawn to:

- 🧠 Computer Science fundamentals  
- 💻 Systems programming & embedded systems  
- 🧩 Challenging software problems  
- ⚙️ Driver development and hardware-specific software  
- 🖥️ Operating systems

I'm always eager to learn something new, dive deep into technical topics, and work on projects that push me out of my comfort zone.
Feel free to check out some of my repositories, projects, and experiments!
